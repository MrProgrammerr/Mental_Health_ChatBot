They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.\"],\n",

Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected.

      "You : Hello Good Morning\n",
      "Bot :  Good morning. How was your rest? How are you feeling this morning?\n",
      "You : What is mental Health\n",
      "Bot :  Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.\n",
      "You : who are you\n",
      "Bot :  I am MentBOT and created by Chandan who trained me on a text dataset using Deep Learning & Natural Language Processing techniques\n",
      "You : who made you\n",
      "Bot :  I'm MentBOT created by Chandan, a Therapeutic AI Assistant designed to assist you. Tell me about yourself.\n",
      "You : okay\n",
      "Bot :  Yes, Tell me more if you need anything?\n",
      "You : Where can I learn about types of mental health treatment?\n",
      "Bot :  You can learn about different types of mental health treatment from various sources such as reputable websites, books, articles, mental health organizations, clinics, hospitals, community centers, and educational institutions. Additionally, you can consult with mental health professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and social workers who can provide information and guidance on available treatment options tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.\n",
      "You : Where can I go to find a support group?\n",
      "Bot :  Many people find peer support a helpful tool that can aid in their recovery. There are a variety of organizations that offer support groups for consumers, their family members and friends. Some support groups are peer-led, while others may be led by a mental health professional.\n",
      "You : What are you capable of.\n",
      "Bot :  My capabilities include offering support for managing anxiety and stress, providing information about mental health topics, and engaging in conversation to promote well-being. Please remember that I'm not a substitute for professional therapy or counseling. If you're experiencing distress, consider reaching out to a licensed mental health professional.\n",
      "You : What should I do if I know someone who appears to have the symptoms of a mental disorder?\n",
      "Bot :  Although MentBOT cannot substitute for professional advice, we encourage those with symptoms to talk to their friends and family members and seek the counsel of a mental health professional. The sooner the mental health condition is identified and treated, the sooner they can get on the path to recovery. If you know someone who is having problems, don't assume that the issue will resolve itself. Let them know that you care about them, and that there are treatment options available that will help them heal. Speak with a mental health professional or counselor if you think your friend or family member is experiencing the symptoms of a mental health condition. If the affected loved one knows that you support them, they will be more likely to seek out help.\n",
      "You : What are some of the warning signs of mental illness?\n",
      "Bot :  Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.\n",
