# MentBOT

## Description
This project involves building a chatbot that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sentiment analysis. The chatbot is designed to respond to queries based on the sentiment of the input, and it has been trained on a dataset containing 80 classes of query-response pairs. The project also includes an API created using Flask for easy integration and deployment.

## Sections
<ol>
    <li>Introduction</li>
The chatbot leverages LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly effective for sequence prediction problems. The sentiment analysis model processes user input to understand the sentiment and provides appropriate responses based on pre-defined classes.
